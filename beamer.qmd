## Poisson regression at St. Olaf

-   02-04: Not taught.  Statistics concentration required Prob Theory and Math Stat plus 2 electives.
-   04-18: Taught as part of Advanced Statistical Modeling (Stat 316).  Concentration required Statistical Modeling (Stat 272) and 316 plus 2 electives.
-   18-24: Still taught in Stat 316.  Concentration renamed "Statistics and Data Science" and required 272 and Intro to Data Science plus 2 electives.  Stat 316 now counts as an upper level elective.
-   24-current: Still taught in Stat 316.  Concentration became a major.  Stat 316 counts as a "Level 3 Stats Depth" elective course.


## Advanced Statistical Modeling at St. Olaf

-   Covers generalized linear models (Poisson regr, binomial regr, negative binomial regr, zero-inflated models, hurdle models, etc.) and multilevel modeling
-   Prerequsites: Intro Stats and Stat Modeling (nothing else -- calculus, linear algebra, computing, ...)
-   Applied focus using R
-   Uses [Beyond Multiple Linear Regression: Applied Generlized Linear Models and Multilevel Models in R](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/) by Roback and Legler.  Second edition by Roback, Boehm Vock, and Legler expected by Fall 2026.


## First case study: Philippine households

```{r}
#| include: FALSE

fHH1 <- read_csv("data/philippines.csv") |>
  mutate(location = as_factor(location),
         roof = as_factor(roof))
```

-   International agencies often use household size to determine the magnitude of the household needs
-   Want to discern factors associated with larger households
-   Data is subset from 2015 Philippine Statistics Authority's Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES)
-   Primary response is a count, which can make linear regression problematic


## Philippine household data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Key variables:

-   `location` = region (Central Luzon, Davao, Ilocos, Metro Manila, or Visayas)
-   `age` = the age of the head of household
-   `total` = the number of people in the household other than the head
-   `numLT5` = the number in the household under 5 years of age 
-   `roof` = the type of roof (stronger material can be used as a proxy for greater wealth)

## Sheena Easton and Game Theory

Sheena Easton describes the following scenario for her baby:

1.  Takes the morning train
2.  Works from nine 'til five
3.  Takes another train home again
4.  Finds Sheena Easton waiting for him

## A Total Conflict Game Between Sheena Easton and Her Baby

|                        | Stays Home    | Goes to Work  |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Baby Home Again**    | -100, **100** | **100**, 0    |
| **Baby Stays at Work** | **50**, 0     | -100, **100** |

Sheena Easton and her baby are playing a **zero-sum (total conflict) game**.

-   Akin to Holmes-Moriarty game (see: von Neumann and Morgenstern)
-   Solution: **mixed strategy**

## Rick Astley's Re-election Platform

Rick Astley's campaign promises:

-   Never gonna give you up.
-   Never gonna let you down.
-   Never gonna run around and desert you.
-   Never gonna make you cry.
-   Never gonna say goodbye.
-   Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

Are these promises (if credible) sufficient to secure re-election?

## Rick Astley and Median Voter Theorem

Whereas these pledges conform to the preferences of the **median voter**, we expect Congressman Astley to secure re-election.

## Caribbean Queen and Operation Urgent Fury

Billy Ocean released "Caribbean Queen" in 1984.

-   Emphasized sharing the same dream
-   Hearts beating as one

"Caribbean Queen" is about the poor execution of Operation Urgent Fury.

-   Echoed JCS chairman David Jones' frustrations with military establishment.

Billy Ocean is advocating for what became the Goldwater-Nichols Act.

-   Wanted to take advantage of **economies of scale**, resolve **coordination problems** in U.S. military.

## The Good Day Hypothesis

We know the following about Ice Cube's day.

1.  The Lakers beat the Supersonics.
2.  No helicopter looked for a murder.
3.  Consumed Fatburger at 2 a.m.
4.  Goodyear blimp: "Ice Cube's a pimp."

## The Good Day Hypothesis

This leads to two different hypotheses:

-   $H_0$: Ice Cube's day is statistically indistinguishable from a typical day.
-   $H_1$: Ice Cube is having a good (i.e. greater than average) day.

These hypotheses are tested using archival data of Ice Cube's life.
